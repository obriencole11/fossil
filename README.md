## A Component-Based autorigger for Maya

Fossil was built with the goal of creating a <strong>fast</strong>, <strong>flexible</strong>, and <strong>accessible</strong> autorigger.
* Build a tool for fast rig prototyping and iteration
* Support a pipeline that involves a diverse selection of characters
* Make rigging accessible without sacrifising flexibility

The component based approach was essential to support a variety of body types. Creature anatomies could vary greatly, so a humanoid focused auto rigger such as Maya's HIK would not work. The code based approach was also necessary for baking the rigs onto existing animation data. Again tools like motionbuilder or HIK would not allow for the variety we needed.

Functionally the tool is inspired by Blizzard's code based rigging for Overwatch, as seen in their talk here: Visually the tool is reminiscent of Unity's component editor, an engine I have much experience with.
