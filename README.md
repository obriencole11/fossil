# Component Based R

Rigtools is a component based autorigger for Maya.

The component based approach was essential to support a variety of body types. Creature anatomies could vary greatly, so a humanoid focused auto rigger such as Maya's HIK would not work. The code based approach was also necessary for baking the rigs onto existing animation data. Again tools like motionbuilder or HIK would not allow for the variety we needed.

Functionally the tool is inspired by Blizzard's code based rigging for Overwatch, as seen in their talk here: Visually the tool is reminiscent of Unity's component editor, an engine I have much experience with.
